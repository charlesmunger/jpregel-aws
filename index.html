        <p>
			The jPregel-aws project comprises a Java-based implementation of Pregel with a package that enables
			deployment on Amazon Web Services with a minimum of fuss.
		</p>
		<p>
			A standard performance test for Pregel is the Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem on a binary tree.
			Using 4 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">AWS cc2.8xlarge instances</a> as workers,
			jpregel currently can complete an SSSP problem on a binary tree of 70M nodes in 25 seconds.

        <p>
	      The jPregel part of this project was originally written by Peter Cappello.
		  The current version does not tolerate machine failures.
	      The Java package to run jPregel on AWS, originally written by Varsha Parthasarathy, has been replaced and significantly extended by Charles Munger.
