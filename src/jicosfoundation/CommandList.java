/**
 * This Command type is used to pass a list of Command objects as a single
 * Command object. The contained Command objects can themselves be of type
 * CommandCollection, thus enabling a single Command object to encapsulate
 * a tree of Command objects.
 *
 * The alternative is to have separate mail methods for add and send. However,
 * the standard case is to send immediately after add. The current design 
 * respects this case: The Mail add method implicitly sends the Mail.
 * CommandList allows the Service to build up several Command objects before 
 * sending them (the non-standard case).
